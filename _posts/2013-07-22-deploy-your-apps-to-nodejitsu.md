Recently we announced built-in support for [deploying to Heroku](/2013-07-09-introducing-continuous-deployment-to-heroku).

Last week we sat together with our awesome customers and good friends from [Nodejitsu](https://www.nodejitsu.com/) and are pleased to announce that we now also offer [first class support](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/nodejitsu/) for continuous deployment to their amazing platform!

All you need to do is add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

    deploy:
      provider: nodejitsu
      user: "YOUR USER NAME"
      api_key: "YOUR API KEY" # can of course be encrypted

But we've made it even simpler than that: If you have [our command line tool](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis) installed, you just use the brand new setup command:

    $ travis setup nodejitsu

Done!

This feature is immediately available to all our users including our [Travis Pro](http://travis-ci.com) customers.

### Conditional deploys

You can make deploys conditional. For instance, if you only want to deploy from the staging branch and only on Node.js 0.11 if it is passing (but you also test on other versions):

    deploy:
      provider: nodejitsu
      user: ...
      api_key: ...
      on:
        node: "0.11"
        branch: staging

For more infos, head over to [the documentation](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/nodejitsu/).

### Provider still missing?
