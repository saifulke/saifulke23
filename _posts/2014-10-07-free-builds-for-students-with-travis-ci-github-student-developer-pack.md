Ever since we launched the product version of Travis CI, we've received numerous
requests by students to support them in their course work. GitHub had
spearheaded the idea of supporting education and academia with discounts on
private repositories.

Today we're happy to announce our education program to offer free continuous
integration to students as part of the [GitHub Student Developer
Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)! We're joining a lineup of fantastic
companies offering their services to students for free, including DNSimple,
DigitalOcean, Stripe and SendGrid.

We want to make sure students have the best tools available for your course work and
be able to use them for free to become a better software developer, systems
administrator, scientist, or writer (yup, you can use Travis CI for any of
these!).

You can find all the details on [GitHub's Student Developer Pack
page](https://education.github.com/pack) and on our own page for the education
program at [education.travis-ci.com](https://education.travis-ci.com).

As a student, simply log in with GitHub. There's nothing special you need to do.
If you're part of GitHub's education program, we detect that automatically and
put you on our education plan.

What's more, as a student your builds are running on our new Docker-based setup,
which we'll be slowly rolling out for general availability over the next couple
of months. Note that the Docker-setup currently doesn't support any commands
requiring `sudo`. More details on this soon!

Happy testing!
