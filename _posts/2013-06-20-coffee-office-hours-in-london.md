We love London, if it be the never ending clouds, the hot and sticky underground, or maybe how it always feels like it is about to rain (or that it is always raining). 

With all that said, we do love London for one special reason alone, it is home to our awesome friends at [Pusher](http://pusher.com)!

Because we love our Pusher friends so much, we thought it would be great to hold a coffee meetup **TOGETHER!**

Come to [Workshop coffee in Clerkenwell, London](http://lanyrd.com/2013/pusher-travis-ci-coffee-meetup/), on Monday the 24th of June from 3pm for a high 5, or maybe to chat about testing, dev ops, or the Queen, and of course, a coffee on Travis and Pusher!

See you there!
