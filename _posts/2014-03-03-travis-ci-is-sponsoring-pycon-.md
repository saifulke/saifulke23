# [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) is sponsoring PyCon 2014
We are excited to announce our sponsorship of [PyCon 2014](https://us.pycon.org/2014/)
in Montréal from 9th to 17th of April.

PyCon is the annual gathering for the discussion and promotion of the
Python programming language.
We will be at the conference and the Sprints to help Pythonistas get
their projects testing on Travis CI.

# A ticket giveaway
We are so excited to be part of PyCon!
To celebrate our sponsorship with you, we are giving away one free ticket to this wonderful conference!
