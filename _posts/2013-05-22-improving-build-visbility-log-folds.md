The log output is an integral part of a build, and we've done quite a few
iterations on how to display it in the best possible way.

The most recent addition, available on <https://travis-ci.org> for a while
already, and now fully rolled out on <https://travis-ci.com>, brings a few
noteworthy improvements to make it easier to pin-point problems with the build.

There's a bigger story at play here about the logs in general, but we'll focus
on the new log viewer for now.

To start with, we made the contrast a bit easier to read, with a darker
background.

More noteworthy though, we added more prominent folds, that hide common commands
whose output usually isn't relevant to the overall build, unless they fail.

We fold all commands other than the ones specified in the `script` section of
your .travis.yml.

To make the build phase more visible in the output, they're also nicely labeled
on the righthand side.

If a folded command fails, returning a non-zero exit code, we don't fold the
section so you can immediately investigate what the problem was.
