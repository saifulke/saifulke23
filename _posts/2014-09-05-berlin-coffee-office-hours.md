It's a well known fact that the Travis CI team is very appreciative of great
coffee, and that we love sharing our enthusiasm. We also enjoy meeting our
customers and chat about all things continuous integration, shipping, production
and, of course, coffee.

We love combining those things into an opportunity for you to grab a coffee with
and on us, and to have a little chat in a relaxed atmosphere.

Next week, just before Josh starts his journey back to the southern hemisphere,
literally dozens of timezones away, he'll be stopping by in Berlin for a few
days.

**Next Tuesday, September 9 2014, we'll be hanging out at Silo Coffee**, one of
our favorite shops in Berlin, in the **morning hours from 9:00-11:30** (okay,
maybe even longer than that, it's kinda our second office).

Coffee is on us, so do come by for a chat and a cup of the greatest coffee
around. Hint: they're serving the greatest breakfast at Silo Coffee as well!
