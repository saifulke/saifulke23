New Zealanders are known to be fashionably late. So in the true spirit of being a New Zealander, and annoucing things at the last minute, I am happy to blog that the transient traveling Travis team member, Josh [(@j2h)](http://twitter.com/j2h) (me), is in **Melbourne** and would love to buy
you a coffee this **Friday** the **1st of March**, from **11am**, at The League of Honest Coffee on [8 Exploration Ln](http://goo.gl/maps/ng7GB).

There is a small catch, if you want a free coffee you'll need to send a tweet to [@toolmantim](http://twitter.com/toolmantim) containing the hashtag #timbieber and then show it to Josh :)

See you there!

Josh
