Late last week, the [HipHop VM](http://hhvm.com) team [shipped version
2.3.0](http://www.hhvm.com/blog/2393/hhvm-2-3-0-and-travis-ci) of their
JIT-based virtual machine for PHP.

Not only does this release use 20% less CPU in Facebook's production environment
than the previous version, comes with support for FastCGI, it's now also
natively supported on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)!

Testing your PHP code on the HipHop VM is easy, just add `hhvm` as your desired
PHP version:

    php:
      - hhvm
