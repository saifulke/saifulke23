Today we crossed a magic number, we've had our five millionth job run for open
source projects on <https://travis-ci.org>!

The happy 5 millionth job run award goes to
[meadsteve/JasminePHP](https://travis-ci.org/meadsteve/JasminePHP/jobs/7179585).

Here's a visual representation of the celebrations in our team's Campfire:

To give you some more statistical context, we're now doing more than 20\_000 job
runs on average every day, around 23\_000 on weekdays, and around 15\_000 on
weekends. Keep on shipping that open source code!

Here's to five million more build jobs!
