We love the Travis CI community.

Over the last few years you have created a wide range of applications, tools, plugins and libraries to make working with Travis CI a breeze.

To share this joy with as many people as possible, we've added an [Apps, Clients and Tools](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/apps/) page to our official documentation.

## Your tool is missing?

Did we miss your tool in the list? Our documentation is [open source](https://github.com/travis-ci/docs-travis-ci-com/blob/gh-pages/user/apps.md), why not send us a pull request? Or [get in touch](mailto:support@travis-ci.com).

## Inspired to build something?

The tools don't provide exactly what you need? You want to build something yourself? We recently [rewrote our API documentation](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-04-30-new-api-docs/) to make it even easier for you to get started. We are very excited to see what you come up with! The page also includes [a list of libraries](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/apps/#libraries) in different programming languages.

We strive to constantly improve your CI experiences and all these tools you've built are a massive inspiration for us. Thank you!
