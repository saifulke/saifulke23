Happy Monday Everyone!

We love starting off the week with great news!

After a bit of a delay, we are happy to let everyone know that our VMs have been updated with a host of fixes, updates, and general polish and shine. From language versions, to services, to system settings.

These VM changes will be live for https://travis-ci.org users tomorrow (Tuesday 18 June, 12pm CEST), and for https://travis-ci.com users on Monday next week (24th June, 12pm CEST).

If you have any issues or requests, please create an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues).

Below are the full details of the updates included in the VM refresh.

Have a great Monday,

Josh and the Travis Team.
