I like coffee.

There, I've said it. At Travis CI, we all like a great cup of coffee (emphasis
is on great!). We appreciate a good flat white (or flattie) just as much as a
freshly brewed filter coffee.

But during summer, the heat calls for something different though. In our first
newsletter last year, we introduced you to the iced AeroPress. Since then, I've
added a few more brewing techniques to my repertoire.

One of them is the cold brew. While there are the going-all-out versions like
this terrific contraption at Blue Bottle's Mint St. shop in San Francisco, there
are simpler versions out there, much more suitable for the little home brewer
like me.

Making cold brew at home is surprisingly easy. All you need is some coffee
grounds, fresh water and a jar. You put the water in the jar, add the coffee
ground, put the glass in the fridge. It's that easy!

The result is pretty amazing. The slow steeping process brings out the full
flavours of the coffee, making cold brew very suitable for Ethiopian or Kenyan
coffees, known for their fruity flavors. I'm currently using the Ethiopian
Kochere from The Barn in Berlin. Yirgacheffes are among my favorite coffees out
there, and the Kochere is no exception.

Hey, we merely skimmed the full instructions, so here's a proper list of steps
to make a cold brew at home (or at work, your colleagues will love you for this
one!)

* Use 9 grams of beans for every 100ml water, fresh beans are a must.
* Grind the beans.
* Pour water into a jar. Mason jars are great for this purpose, but any glass
  that closes properly will do. The bigger, the more cold brew you can make in
  one go.
* Add the coffee grounds.
* Give the whole thing a good stir.
* Put in the fridge for at least 12 hours. The longer the better, but overnight
  works quite well.
* Sift the brewage. This is a bit tricky, and I don't recommend using paper
  filters. A cloth or a cloth filter from the Hario drip pot work much better.
  It's also good to pour in batches, as lots of tiny sediments will collect in
  the filter, making the draining slower and slower.

Enjoy on ice!
